# TREATMENTS for Heart Disease

## Angioplasty and Stents (PCI)

This procedure involves inflating a small balloon inside a narrowed coronary artery to widen it, often followed by placing a stent—a small mesh tube—to keep the artery open and maintain proper blood flow. Think of the stent as a retaining wall, keeping sufficient blood flow through the coronary artery to the heart muscle, eventually this stent becomes imbedded within the coronary artery and remains in place permanently.

## Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

CABG is performed when coronary arteries have numerous blockages or when the blockages are in places within the coronary arteries that are not amenable to stents. Surgeons create a new pathway for blood flow to the heart muscle by grafting blood vessels from other parts of the body, typically your arm or leg, bypassing the blocked arteries. The surgery requires cutting through the sternum (breastbone) to access the heart and impacts on your recovery.

## Heart Valve Surgery

When heart valves are damaged or diseased, they may require repair or replacement. They can become stiff, calcified or leaky and this impairs the flow of blood through the heart, contributing to symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath or syncope. Replacement or Repair techniques include strengthening the valve or repairing supporting structures, while replacement involves substituting the faulty valve with a mechanical or biological one.

## Pacemakers and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs)

Devices implanted under the skin to help regulate abnormal heart rhythms by sending electrical impulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate, especially in cases of arrhythmias. Defibrillators will work to correct your hearts dangerous rhythm if required by delivering a shock.

## Medical Therapy

If stents or surgery are not the best option for you, your heart disease may be managed with medical therapy which is aimed at relieving your symptoms and preventing progression of your coronary artery disease.
