When heart issues occur, effective management often involves a combination of medications, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes to manage and improve your heart's health.

Let's have a look at the types of medications, and what they do. Click on your specific medication to understand more:

## Medication Types and Uses

### Blood Thinners (Antiplatelets and Anticoagulants)
Often referred to as 'blood thinners', these help prevent blood clots, reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

**Antiplatelets:** You will typically be on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), meaning two medications, aspirin and Clopidogrel OR Ticagrelor after a stent.

- [Aspirin low dose](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/aspirin-low-dose/)
- [Ticagrelor](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/t/ticagrelor/)

**Anticoagulants:** If you have had valve surgery you may be on warfarin.
E.g. warfarin, [anticoagulants](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/anticoagulants/): warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban

### Beta Blockers
These medications help the heart relax, lower blood pressure, and reduce strain on the heart. They help your heart muscle recover after a heart attack and can help reduce angina.

E.g. metoprolol, bisoprolol

- [Beta blockers](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/b/beta-blockers/): atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol

### Cholesterol-Lowering Medications (Statins)
Statins help lower cholesterol, reducing the buildup of fatty deposits in arteries. They also help stabilize coronary artery disease/plaque that is already present, lowering future risk.

E.g. atorvastatin, simvastatin, ezetimibe

- [Statins](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/s/statins/): atorvastain, pravastatin, simvastatin

### ACE Inhibitors
These protect the heart and may be used to lower blood pressure.

E.g. perindopril, enalapril

- [ACE inhibitors](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/ace-inhibitors/): lisinopril, quinapril, perindopril

### Diuretics
These help remove excess fluid.

- [Diuretics](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/d/diuretics/): frusemide, metolazone, spironotactone, bumetanide

### Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
Often used as an alternative to ACE inhibitors and work in a similar way.

- [Angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/angiotensin-receptor-blockers-arbs/): candesartan, losartan

### Antianginals
These help manage your angina symptoms.

- [Isosorbide Mononitrate](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/i/isosorbide-mononitrate)
