# Managing Your Medication

When starting new heart medications, it's normal to have concerns. Common things you might come across include:

## Potential Side Effects

Some medications can cause side effects such as dizziness, an upset stomach, tiredness, or skin irritation. While many side effects are mild and may go away over time, it's important to monitor and report any that are severe or persistent to your doctor or pharmacist. They can assess your symptoms and adjust your treatment if necessary. It's important not to stop taking your medication without professional guidance, as the benefits often outweigh the side-effects. **We do not expect you to put up with debilitating side-effects as you can always contact your Heart Health Recovery team to discuss these!**

## Cost of Medication

Often you will have to pay a small fee when you collect a prescription, which can vary depending on the medication and the pharmacy—so it's worth comparing prices locally. The Government runs a [prescription subsidy scheme](https://www.govt.nz/browse/health/gps-and-prescriptions/prescription-subsidy-scheme/#possible-prescription-costs-7340) for individuals and families who are prescribed a lot of medication. Once you or your family has paid for 20 new prescription items in one year, any further prescriptions will be free until the following year. You may also qualify for reduced costs with a [Community Services Card](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/a-z-benefits/community-services-card.html) or [High Use Health Card](https://www.govt.nz/browse/health/financial-help/high-use-health-card/) (if you've had 12+ GP visits in a year). Speak to your pharmacist to see what you're eligible for.

## Taking It Right

Make sure you understand when and how to take your medication. Misunderstandings can lead to missed doses or incorrect usage, impacting your treatment's effectiveness. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

# Tips & Tricks for Taking Your Medication

## Organise your Medications

Most pharmacies offer blister packs, which puts your medications into plastic pockets. It's a great way to stay organised without sorting pills every day. Or, you could use a pillbox with the days of the week on it, if you want to sort your medication at home. Managing repeat prescriptions can also be made easier with tools like ManageMyHealth or your GPs online portal. Many pharmacies offer text reminders or automatic repeat services to help you stay ahead.

## Set Reminders

Whether it's a phone alarm, an app, or even a good old-fashioned note on the fridge, having something to prompt you at the right time can be a game changer. Linking your meds to a daily routine—like brushing your teeth, having breakfast, or making your morning coffee—also helps reinforce the habit. Smartwatches or voice assistants like Alexa or Siri can help too.

## Keep a Medication List

It's a good idea to keep an up-to-date list of your medications. You can get this from your pharmacy or GP, and having a photo of it on your phone makes it easy to bring to appointments or hospital visits. If anything changes, update the list straight away.

## Involve Friends and Whānau

Lastly, don't be afraid to involve whānau. A trusted family member or friend can offer gentle reminders, check in with you, or just be there as a bit of backup as you get used to your new routine.

And here's a bonus tip: ask your pharmacist about a **Medicines Use Review (MUR)**. It's a free service where they sit down with you and go through all your medications, explaining them and checking for any issues. It's well worth doing.
