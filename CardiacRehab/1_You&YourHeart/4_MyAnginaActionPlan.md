# My Angina Action Plan

If you have had a heart attack, then you have likely had an angiogram.

[More information: https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/your-heart/heart-tests/your-heart-angiogram](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/your-heart/heart-tests/your-heart-angiogram)

If your angiogram has managed to open your narrowed coronary arteries, then you are likely considered 're-vascularised' which means your narrowing's have been treated and you should typically not experience angina.

Alternatively, you may have some narrowing's that cannot be opened with a stent (percutaneous intervention – PCI) and these may require management with medications. If you are unsure what your angiogram showed you can ask your healthcare team.

If you develop angina, using GTN spray can help to relieve your symptoms by opening the blood vessels, improving the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle.

## Safety considerations:

1. Tell someone you are having pain
2. Sit down
3. Do not take GTN spray if you are dizzy
4. Do not drive

## Follow the 3 steps on the angina action plan when using GTN spray

### Step 01
• If you are having angina symptoms, stop what you are doing and rest now
• Tell someone how you are feeling
• Take 1 puff of your GTN spray

*Wait 5 minutes*

### Step 02
• If you still have symptoms after 5 mins, take 1 more puff of your GTN spray

*Wait 5 minutes*

### Step 03
• If you still have symptoms after another 5 minutes, treat it as a heart attack - **dial 111 and ask for an ambulance**
• Chew an aspirin if advised by a paramedic

**IMPORTANT:** If your symptoms go away, you can resume your activities gently. If your angina becomes more frequent, severe, lasts longer or happens when you are doing very little or resting, see your doctor in the next 24 hours.
