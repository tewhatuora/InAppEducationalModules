# Your Heart

**Video:** [How your heart works – Heart Foundation NZ](https://www.talkingaboutmedicines.com/videos/v/how-the-heart-works)

Your heart is a vital muscular organ, approximately the size of your clenched fist, which powers the body. Its primary function is to pump blood throughout your body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to every cell, nerve, muscle and vital organ and removing waste products like carbon dioxide.

Your heart sits in your chest between your lungs, slightly to the left of centre, and is protected by your rib cage.

## How the Heart Pumps

The heart has its own electrical system that controls your heartbeat. Regular electrical signals cause the heart to pump blood in a steady rhythm around the body, and to and from the lungs.

## Parts of the Heart

### Chambers

The heart consists of four chambers—two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Here's how it works:

- **Blood Enters the Heart** – Oxygen-poor blood from your body flows into the **right atrium**, then moves into the **right ventricle**.

- **Blood Travels to the Lungs** – The right ventricle pumps blood to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen.

- **Oxygen-Rich Blood Returns** – Fresh, oxygen-rich blood flows back to the **left atrium**, then into the **left ventricle**.

- **Blood is Pumped to the Body** – The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood out through the **aorta**, delivering it to your organs and muscles.

### Valves

In between chambers, your heart has **valves** that work like one-way doors, keeping blood moving in the right direction. Four valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart:

- **Tricuspid Valve:** Between the right atrium and right ventricle.

- **Pulmonary Valve:** Between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery leading to the lungs.

- **Mitral Valve:** Between the left atrium and left ventricle.

- **Aortic Valve:** Between the left ventricle and the aorta, which distributes blood to the body.

### Heart Wall

The walls of your heart are composed of three layers, each with a specific function essential to your heart's operation:

- **Endocardium (Inner Layer):** This thin layer lines the interior of the heart's chambers and valves, providing a smooth surface that facilitates efficient blood flow within the heart.

- **Myocardium (Middle Layer):** As the thick, muscular layer, the myocardium is responsible for the heart's contractile function. It generates the force needed to pump blood throughout the body, ensuring that oxygen and nutrients reach various tissues.

## Blood Vessels

Your body has a network of blood vessels that transport blood to and from the heart, ensuring oxygen and nutrients reach every part of the body. There are three main types of blood vessels:

- **Arteries**: These vessels carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body's tissues. The largest artery, the aorta, branches into smaller arteries, delivering oxygen and nutrients to various organs and muscles.

- **Veins**: After the oxygen has been delivered, veins carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart. From there, it's pumped to the lungs to receive fresh oxygen. Veins have valves that prevent blood from flowing backward, ensuring it moves efficiently toward the heart.

- **Capillaries**: These are tiny, thin-walled vessels that connect arteries and veins. Capillaries facilitate the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the body's cells. Their thin walls allow oxygen and nutrients to pass from the blood into the tissues and waste products to move from the tissues into the blood for removal.

## Coronary Arteries

Your **coronary arteries** are the small blood vessels that **supply your heart with oxygen and nutrients**. Just like your body needs blood to stay healthy, your heart muscle needs its own blood supply to keep pumping.

- **Where are they?** The coronary arteries wrap around the surface of your heart, branching off from the **aorta** (the main artery that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body).

- **What do they do?** They deliver **oxygen-rich blood** to your heart muscle, helping it work properly.

- **Why are they important?** If these arteries become **narrowed or blocked** (due to fatty deposits called **plaque**), your heart might not get enough oxygen. This can cause **chest pain (angina)** or even a **heart attack** if a blockage stops blood flow completely.

**Think of your heart like a house, with a plumbing and electrical system.**

**Walls (Heart Muscle):** Strong walls keep the house standing, just like your heart muscle pumps blood around your body.

**Rooms (Heart Chambers):** Your house has different rooms for different purposes—your heart has four chambers that separate oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood.

**Doors (Heart Valves):** Doors open and close to control movement—your valves do the same, ensuring blood flows in the right direction.

**Pipes (Blood Vessels):** Just like plumbing carries water, your arteries and veins transport oxygen and nutrients to your body.

**Electrical System (Heart's Rhythm):** Your house needs wiring to power everything—your heart has an electrical system that keeps it beating steadily.

If any part of the house weakens, repairs (medications, procedures, lifestyle changes) can help keep it strong and working well.
