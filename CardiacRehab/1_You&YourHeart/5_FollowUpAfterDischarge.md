# Follow Up After Discharge From Hospital

## GP Follow Up

It is recommended that you see your GP within 1 week – 10 days following discharge. **You must make this appointment yourself.** This is to check your blood pressure, heart rate, puncture site/surgical wounds and review your new medications. You may also have sutures that require removal.

## Prescriptions

You must fill your script on the day you are discharged (ideally in Wellington due to timing and pharmacy hours) as you will be due medications the same evening and following morning. You will receive a script for 3 months (for your new cardiac medications). Your GP will need to complete the repeat prescription for you **prior to** you finishing your supply and will continue to manage your prescription going forward.

## Cardiology Follow Up

• **Wellington, Kāpiti & Porirua residents** - you will receive a letter in the mail with details of your Cardiology Clinic follow up, typically around 3 months.

• **Residents from outside the Wellington region** – we refer you back to your local hospital to arrange follow up if required. *If you have not received an appointment – you need to contact your hospital, please be wary some services have capacity constraints currently.*
