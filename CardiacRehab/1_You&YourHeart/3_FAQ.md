## Q: Is angina the same as a heart attack?

**A:** No, angina is not the same as a heart attack.

Unlike a heart attack, angina doesn't cause permanent damage to the heart muscle. The pain often goes away with rest or angina medicines. This is known as **'stable angina'**.

A heart attack can be a **NSTEMI or STEMI** (myocardial infarction) and the diagnosis reflects how much of the coronary artery is occluded and to what degree, some may be partial and transient and some completely.

If you experience angina when you're resting, this is a sign that your coronary heart disease might be getting worse. This is known as **'unstable angina'**. Let your **healthcare team** know so they can arrange tests or treatment.

## Q: Why is a heart attack, and how is it different from cardiac arrest?

**A:** A heart attack happens when one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart gets blocked, usually by a clot or fatty build-up, and this stops oxygen from reaching part of the heart muscle, causing damage. **A cardiac arrest, on the other hand, is when the heart can no longer pump blood** (due) as the electrical conduction has become uncoordinated, this is called **ventricular fibrillation**. This causes the person to collapse and stop breathing. While a heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest, they are not the same thing. **Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that needs CPR and defibrillation straight away, and calling 111 immediately can save a life.**

## Q: What are the warning signs of a heart attack?

**A:** The most common sign is **chest discomfort**—this might feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It may also spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Other symptoms include feeling short of breath, sick (nauseous), sweaty, or light-headed. Some people—especially women—might not get classic chest pain but instead feel unusually tired, dizzy, or experience discomfort like indigestion. **If you or someone else shows these signs, it's vital to call 111 straight away.**
