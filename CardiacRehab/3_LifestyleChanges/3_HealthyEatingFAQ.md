# Heart-Healthy Eating FAQ

## 🧂 1. Do I really have to cut out salt completely?

Not completely, but reducing salt helps lower blood pressure.

Swap salt for herbs, lemon juice, garlic, and spices. Choose products with less than 120mg sodium per 100g when reading labels.

## 🥖 2. Is white bread really that bad?

White bread isn't "bad," but wholegrain or wholemeal bread has more fibre, which helps lower cholesterol and keep you full. Try a gradual swap — mix and match to start.

## 🥩 3. Can I still eat red meat?

Yes — in moderation. Choose lean cuts, trim visible fat, and limit processed meats like sausages or bacon. Try having fish, legumes, or chicken on most days. Try to aim for two vegetarian meals per week and focus on your portion sizes when having meat!

## 🐟 4. Is fish and chips okay occasionally?

Yes — occasionally is the key word. Bake or grill fish at home more often, and if you do have takeaways, try:

- Asking for grilled instead of battered
- Skipping the extra salt
- Sharing chips or swapping some for salad

## 🧈 5. Is butter really that bad? What about margarine?

Butter is high in saturated fat. Use it sparingly or switch to a heart-healthy spread like one made from canola, olive, or avocado oil. Look for the Heart Foundation tick.

## 🥛 6. Should I drink low-fat milk or full-fat?

Low-fat or reduced-fat milk is recommended for heart health — it has less saturated fat but still provides calcium and protein. If you're used to full-fat, try gradually adjusting.

## 🥣 7. What can I eat for breakfast if I don't want cereal?

Try:

- Porridge with fruit and nuts
- Eggs on wholegrain toast
- Yoghurt with oats and berries
- A smoothie with banana, milk, oats, and spinach

## 🍚 8. Are rice and potatoes bad for my heart?

No — it's about portion size and what you eat with them. Choose brown rice or kūmara for extra fibre. Keep portions to about a fist size.

## 🍬 9. Can I still have dessert or sweet treats?

Yes — occasionally, and in small portions. Try:

- Fruit and yoghurt
- Stewed fruit with oats
- Dark chocolate (a couple squares)
- Baking with less sugar or using fruit to sweeten

## 🥫 10. Are canned foods okay?

Yes — look for "no added salt" or "low salt" options. Rinse beans or veg under water before cooking to reduce sodium even further.

## 💊 11. Do I need supplements or special "heart" foods?

No supplements are needed for most people. You can get what your heart needs from everyday whole foods. If you're low in iron, B12, or calcium, your doctor will advise.

## 👴🏽 12. I'm in my 70s/80s — is it too late to make a difference?

Not at all! It's never too late. Eating better can:

- Improve your energy and digestion
- Help medications work better
- Reduce your risk of future events
- Improve quality of life

## 👩🏽‍🍳 13. How can I make healthier meals that my whole whānau will eat?

Start with small swaps: brown rice, extra veg in stews, less salt in cooking. Involve whānau in choosing and preparing meals — cooking together builds support and buy-in.
