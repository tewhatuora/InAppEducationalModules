# For Long Term Heart Health

## What type of exercise is recommended?

### Aerobic Exercise
Any activity using large muscle groups, maintained continuously and rhythmic in nature

**Examples:** running, swimming, cycling, rowing

**Recommendations:** A minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-high intensity aerobic exercise per week.

**High intensity interval training (HIIT)** is encouraged but: this is 4x4 minute intervals (2-3x/week)

### Resistance Training
Activity that involves contraction of one or more muscle groups against external resistance to enhance muscle mass, strength and endurance

**Recommendations:** 2-3x/week of >20mins

**Fun fact:** Adding resistance to aerobic exercise significantly improves cardiorespiratory function and body composition in patients with coronary artery disease

### Physical Activity
Body movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure eg gardening and housework

**Recommendations:** daily resulting in >150mins per week or >7,500 steps per day

It is important to draw a line between exercise and being physically active, physical activity is beneficial, but this is not actively exercising. Eg. gardening, walking the dog, vacuuming
