The great picture of what to eat most is the key thing and the things to avoid.

## Get Moving

Regular physical activity strengthens your heart muscle, improves circulation, boosts your energy and improves mood, and helps maintain a healthy weight and blood pressure. Guidelines recommend 150 minutes moderate intensity exercise per week plus some resistance training sessions – please refer to our exercise section.

## Smoking Cessation

If you smoke, quitting reduces the risk of heart disease and improves your overall heart health. We know that as well as the toxic chemicals in cigarettes, smoking makes your LDL cholesterol stickier, contributing to your risk of heart attack and stroke. It's not easy—but you're not alone. Support from your GP, Quitline, or a cardiac rehab team can make a big difference.

## Alcohol Moderation

Alcohol can affect your heart health by increasing blood pressure, contributing to abnormal heart rhythms, and placing extra strain on the heart. Reducing your alcohol intake can support your recovery and long-term wellbeing. We recommend sticking to standard drink advice for women and men and having at least two alcohol free nights per week.
