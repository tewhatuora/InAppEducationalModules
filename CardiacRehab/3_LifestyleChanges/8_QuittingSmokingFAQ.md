# Qutting Smoking FAQ

## Is it really worth quitting at my age?

**Yes. 100%.**

Even if you're in your 70s or 80s, quitting smoking improves your breathing, energy, sleep, circulation, and heart health. You'll likely live longer — and feel better doing it.

## Will quitting actually help my heart, even after a heart attack?

Yes. Stopping smoking reduces your risk of another heart event more than almost any medication. Your blood vessels start healing quickly, and your heart doesn't have to work as hard.

## What if I've smoked for 40+ years — is the damage already done?

Some damage might be there, but your body still starts repairing itself within hours of quitting. The benefits are real, no matter how long you've smoked.

## Isn't it too stressful to quit right now?

It might feel that way — especially if you're recovering, anxious, or down. But smoking actually increases stress on your heart. Quitting can lower anxiety in the long run. Start slow, and ask for support.

## I've tried to quit before and failed. Why bother again?

Because most people need a few goes before it sticks. Each attempt teaches you what works. Don't beat yourself up — if you're thinking about quitting, you're already on the path.

## What about vaping — is it safer?

Vaping is less harmful than smoking, but it's not risk-free. It can be a short-term tool to help you quit cigarettes — but the goal should still be to be nicotine-free in the long run. Talk to your doctor or Quitline.

## What can I do when I get cravings?

- Go for a walk
- Drink a glass of water
- Breathe deeply or chew gum
- Call a mate or talk to whānau
- Distract yourself — cravings usually pass in 5-10 minutes

## Will I gain weight if I quit?

Some people do, but not everyone. Even with a small weight gain, quitting still gives huge heart benefits. Focus on healthy snacks, moving your body, and don't stress too much about a few extra kilos at first.

## Is nicotine replacement safe for someone with heart issues?

Yes — nicotine patches, gum, and lozenges are safe for most people, even after a heart event. They're much safer than smoking. Always check with your nurse, GP, or pharmacist first.
