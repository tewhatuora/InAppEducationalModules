# Healthy Eating

Cardiac rehab isn't just about physical recovery — it's also about giving your heart the fuel it needs to stay strong. Whether you're:

• Recovering from a heart event
• Managing high cholesterol or blood pressure
• Living with heart failure
• Or just wanting to stay well

Eating well for your heart doesn't mean giving up your culture or favourite meals. It means finding balance — and making small changes that support your health, your whānau, and your future.

## What to Cut Back On

**Cut back on junk foods, takeaways, and foods or drinks high in sugar, salt, saturated or trans fats.**

### Cutting Back on Sugar

Sugar adds extra calories to food that we don't need. Because it doesn't fill us up, it's easy to have too much of it, and that can make us put on weight. It also has a small effect on raising cholesterol levels and blood pressure. While the natural sugars already present in foods such as plain milk and fruit aren't a problem, there can be a lot of extra sugar added to foods and drinks.

### Cutting Back on Salt

Most of us eat far too much salt – in fact, one and a half times the recommended maximum intake. So try taking a lighter hand to the salt shaker, or better still, ditch the salt altogether. Even more importantly, check food labels for the salt content (salt is listed as sodium on labels), and go for lower sodium options.

### Cutting Back on Saturated and Trans Fats

Saturated fat is found in higher amounts in foods containing animal fats. The healthy fats are unsaturated fats and are found in high amounts in plant foods like nuts, seeds, plant oils, and avocado, as well as in oily fish. Eating these in place of animal fats contributes to a heart-healthy way of eating, that improves cholesterol levels and reduces your risk of heart disease.

Eating less manufactured trans fats means eating less processed foods. Trans fats are found most commonly in foods containing partially-hydrogenated oils and in some bakery and pastry products, popcorn, potato crisps, takeaway foods, and breakfast bars.
