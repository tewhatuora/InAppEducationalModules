# FAQ - Exercise

## Q: Is it safe to exercise if I have a heart condition?

**A:** Yes, but it's important to get advice from your doctor, nurse, physiotherapist or any other health care specialist in your team, before starting something new. Think of your heart like any other muscle, the stronger it gets, the healthier it is. Exercise will strengthen your heart muscle and improve its function and is deemed to be safe in those with coronary artery disease. If you have coronary artery disease it is important to check in with your team before engaging in high intensity exercise or competitive sports. Please refer to our section on exercise and the rate of perceived exertion scale as we recommend moderate intensity exercise.

## Q: Why is regular physical activity so important for heart health?

**A:** Regular movement helps strengthen your heart muscle, lowers blood pressure, supports a healthy weight, and reduces stress. It can also improve your sleep, boost your mood, and help prevent conditions like diabetes and stroke. Simply put, moving more means living better.

## Q: What happens if I get angina when I exercise?

**A:** If you have been prescribed GTN spray, you should have this with you when you are exercising. Exercise results in the heart muscle needing more blood supply, oxygen in nutrients so you may get angina.

This DOES not mean that you should avoid exercise, you should exercise feeling confident in what to do to manage your symptoms. If you experience angina, sit down and rest, tell someone you have pain and take your GTN, following your angina action plan.

If you are having more frequent episodes of angina or these are occurring commonly at rest, please talk to your healthcare team.

## Q: What happens if I get dizzy/lightheaded when I exercise?

**A:** Sit down until it resolves, elevate your legs if needed, tell someone you are dizzy, stay hydrated. Do not take your GTN if you are dizzy.
