# Exercise

If you are recovering from an acute coronary syndrome event, STEMI, NSTEMI, Unstable angina, rest for 2 weeks then aim to return to your usual level of activity within three to four. After 4 weeks as a general rule, you should be back to your usual self and this is the time to think about increasing your exercise and activity.

If you are recovering post cardiac surgery, with a sternotomy, you should be resting and recovering for 4-6 weeks and focuses on increasing your walking in line with the below graph: Walking is low impact on the rest of the body and should be the initial focus along with completing your ADLs -

However, if you are struggling to complete your ADLS, cooking, personal hygiene cares and household tasks you should prioritise these along with developing a routine before focusing on increasing your exercise. It's an individual journey and these are suggestions only!

## Exercise Progression Schedule

| Week | Exercise time | Effort |
|------|---------------|--------|
| 1-2  | 5min, 3x daily | 10-20% |
| 3-4  | 10min, 3x daily | 20-30% |
| 5-6  | 15min, 2x daily | 30-50% |

In terms of 'effort' you should be working in the light-moderate zone which is numbered 2-6 in the rate of perceived exertion scale below:

This will help your heart muscle slowly recover and strengthen in the initial recovery stage (4-6 weeks). Your family and friends can help monitor your effort when exercising by ensuring you can talk and hold a conversation. Remember you do not need to push yourself into the yellow zone!

## RPE Scale (Rate of Perceived Exertion)

| Level | Activity Type | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Very light activity | It doesn't even feel like you're exercising. |
| 2-3 | Light activity | You could keep going for hours! It's easy to breathe and have a conversation. |
| 4-6 | Moderate activity | You're breathing heavily, but you can have a conversation. |
| 7-8 | Somewhat difficult activity | You're short of breath. You can speak, but only about one sentence at a time. |
| 9 | Very difficult activity | You can barely breathe, and can only say a few words at a time. |
| 10 | Maximum effort activity | You're completely out of breath, and can't talk. |

**Initial Goal:** Move your body most days, develop a routine, complete your ADLs and light walking programme as energy allows. "Start low, go slow, and keep going."

## For Post-Cardiac Surgery: "Move in the Tube" Concept

For those post cardiac surgery, for the first 6 weeks you must **'move in the tube'**

Moving within the tube is movement that you can do with your body, within a visual cylinder. Especially important with upper limbs.

The strain exerted on the sternum from pectoral muscles, if movement is away from the body (not within the visual 'tube' field) has a higher force. This can increase the risk of sternal complications in the recovery stage.

You should think about undertaking all activities bilaterally, keep loads close to the body & use pain as the guide and brace when coughing.

You can progress to moving outside the tube as pain and confidence allows! Remember, pain is the guide.

**Examples:**
- **✅ CORRECT:** Lifting a bag should be close to the body as oppose to with arms extended
- **❌ INCORRECT:** A golf swing is not within the tube
- **✅ CORRECT:** A golf putt is within the tube  
- **✅ CORRECT:** Standing up from sitting with arms crossed across body is within the tube
- **❌ INCORRECT:** Pushing yourself up, one sided off an arm rest is not
