# Other Things to Consider

## Sleep Support

Sleep after a heart event is often disrupted. Apps like **Insight Timer** or **Sleepful NZ** can help.

## Sex & Intimacy

Many patients are unsure when it's safe to resume sex — simple, open info here is helpful. We would say that resuming sexual intimacy is safe and does not exert more strain than other activity or exercise – this is good for them to read.

It is good to note that some medications such as beta blockers may impair sexual function for men and then they may want to discuss this with their team and that in the initial recovery stages.

## Travel & Driving

**When can they drive again? Fly? Go on holiday?**

It differs based on diagnosis and intervention but likely **2 – 4 weeks**. It is driven by NZTA and there is a guideline.

It's probably reasonable to just state **2 weeks is the typical driving stand-down** post the date of their heart attack or **4 weeks post the date of their surgery** but if they are unsure, ask us. This is what we have written in a document we provide on discharge:

### Resuming Driving

As per NZTA rules, a driving stand-down applies to a normal passenger vehicle license – you must not drive for **2 weeks from the date of your heart attack (NSTEMI/STEMI)**. If you have had a heart attack but have had an angiogram, you must not drive for **48hrs following your procedure**. *If you hold a special class license you will likely require an exercise tolerance test (ETT) prior to obtaining this back: please discuss this with your Cardiology Team*

## Returning to Work or Volunteering

**What's realistic? Who can help with planning?**

It differs but typically **2-4 weeks post ACS event** and **4-6 weeks post surgery**. We should have discussed this on discharge from hospital and it should be well documented in discharge paperwork, but we can direct back to us as their healthcare team if they're not sure and also state that if they need support with returning to work or medical certificates to support them they should reach out.
