# Why This Matters for Your Recovery

Depression is linked to **poorer recovery**, lower physical activity, and **reduced medication adherence.**

Anxiety can make it harder to stick to rehab or even attend appointments.

Ongoing stress can increase the risk of future heart events (British Heart Foundation).

**Treating your mental health improves your physical outcomes.**

## What You Can Do – Tools and Support That Work

### Talk About It

- Speak to your GP, nurse, or cardiac rehab team if you're struggling

### Try These Self-Help Tools

These are backed by evidence and recommended by all three Heart Foundations:
