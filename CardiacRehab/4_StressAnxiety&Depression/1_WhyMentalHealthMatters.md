# Why Mental Health Matters in Heart Recovery

After a heart event like a heart attack, bypass surgery, or diagnosis of heart disease, it's common to feel overwhelmed. Many people experience emotional ups and downs — stress, anxiety, low mood, or even depression. These are **normal responses**, but they can impact your recovery if left unaddressed.

Around **1 in 3 people** experience **depression or anxiety** after a heart event (Heart Foundation NZ).

Mental health and heart health are closely linked — people with ongoing stress or depression are more likely to experience further heart issues.

**Key point**: Looking after your mental wellbeing is just as important as managing your blood pressure or taking your meds.

## Common Emotional Responses After a Heart Event

### Stress

- Feeling tense, restless, or wound-up
- Sleep problems
- Snapping at people, irritability
- Muscle tightness or stomach issues
- Racing thoughts

Stress can increase blood pressure and make the heart work harder. Long-term stress may raise levels of inflammation in the body — something that's bad news for heart health.

### Anxiety

- Constant worrying or panic
- Fear about your health, the future, or another heart event
- Racing heart or breathlessness
- Avoiding physical activity because it "feels unsafe"

People recovering from heart events sometimes confuse normal recovery symptoms (like shortness of breath) with anxiety symptoms. That overlap can make anxiety worse.

### Depression

- Feeling down, flat, or numb for more than two weeks
- Loss of interest in things you used to enjoy
- Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
- Changes in appetite or weight
- Withdrawing from friends and whānau

Depression isn't just "feeling sad" — it's a real condition that affects your energy, motivation, and ability to look after your health.
